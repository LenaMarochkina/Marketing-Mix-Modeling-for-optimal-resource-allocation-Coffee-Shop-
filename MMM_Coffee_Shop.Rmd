# Detect outliers in unit_price within each product_id group
detect_outliers_by_product <- function(column) {
  mean_val <- mean(column, na.rm = TRUE)
  sd_val <- sd(column, na.rm = TRUE)
  
  # Define bounds using the three-sigma rule
  lower_bound <- mean_val - 3 * sd_val
  upper_bound <- mean_val + 3 * sd_val
  
  # Return outliers
  outliers <- column < lower_bound | column > upper_bound
  return(outliers)
}

# Apply outlier detection for unit_price by product_id
outliers_by_product_price <- data_sales %>%

  # Filter for products that have price outliers
  filter(any(price_outliers)) %>%

```

Upon analysis, it was determined that outlier detection for *transaction_qty* is unnecessary, as the observed range (1–8) reflects typical and reasonable purchase quantities.

Similarly, no outliers were removed for *unit_price*, as all values, including price reductions of up to 50% (price_id = 9), are consistent with pricing strategies such as discounts or promotions.

Given the acceptability of the data, no further outlier treatment is required for either *transaction_qty* or *unit_price*, ensuring that the dataset remains representative of normal business operations.

Coffee beans and Branded products may be higher-priced items, leading to higher per-transaction sales even though they have fewer units sold.
Coffee and Tea are likely lower-priced items but are sold in much larger quantities, contributing more significantly to the overall revenue, even though their average sales per transaction are lower.

**Key Observations:**

1.  *Coffee* is the top-performing product category in both quantity and value. It has the highest number of units sold and also generates the most revenue.

2.  *Tea* is the second most popular category, both in terms of the number of units sold and total revenue, though its sales figures are significantly lower than Coffee.

3.  *Bakery* and *Drinking Chocolate* show moderate sales in both quantity and value, ranking third and fourth in both metrics.

There’s a clear concentration of sales in a few major categories (Coffee, Tea, and Bakery), with the other categories contributing much smaller amounts.

### 4.1.2.   Sales By Product Type

There are 29 distinct product types in the dataset. To streamline the analysis, I chose to focus on the product types that belong to the top-selling product categories. These top categories were identified as those contributing at least 10% of the total revenue. This threshold is flexible and can be adjusted as needed. 

``` {r product type}
# Calculate total sales income across all categories
total_sales_income <- sum(sales_by_category$total_sales_value, na.rm = TRUE)

# Filter product categories that contribute at least 10% of the total income
significant_categories <- sales_by_category %>%
  filter(total_sales_value >= 0.1 * total_sales_income) %>%
  pull(product_category)

# Filter the data for the most valuable product_category
sales_by_type_significant <- data_sales %>%
  filter(product_category %in% significant_categories) %>%
  group_by(product_category, product_type) %>%
  summarise(
    total_sales_qty = sum(transaction_qty, na.rm = TRUE),
    total_sales_value = sum(transaction_qty * unit_price, na.rm = TRUE),
    count_transactions = n()  # Count of transactions for each product type
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_sales_value))

# Function to create bar plots for product types within categories
plot_sales_categories <- function(data, x_var, y_var, fill_var, title, y_label, y_breaks_by, label_prefix = "") {
  ggplot(data, aes(x = reorder(get(x_var), -get(y_var)), y = get(y_var), fill = get(fill_var))) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge2(width = 0.9)) +
    geom_text(aes(label = paste(label_prefix, round(get(y_var)), sep = ""), 
                  y = get(y_var) / 2),
              size = 3, 
              fontface = "bold", 
              colour = "white",
              position = position_dodge2(width = 0.9), 
              vjust = 0.5) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = comma, 
                       breaks = seq(0, max(data[[y_var]]) * 1.2, by = y_breaks_by),
                       limits = c(0, max(data[[y_var]]) * 1.2)) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = merged_palette) +
    labs(title = title, 
         x = "Product Category", 
         y = y_label,
         fill = "Product Type") +
    coord_flip()+
    theme_custom +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
          legend.position = "right")
}

# Call the function for total sales quantity
plot_sales_categories(sales_by_type_significant, 
                      x_var = "product_category", 
                      y_var = "total_sales_qty", 
                      fill_var = "product_type", 
                      title = "Total Sales Quantity by Product Category and Product Type", 
                      y_label = "Total Sales Quantity", 
                      y_breaks_by = 2500,
                      label_prefix = "n = ")

# Call the function for total sales value
plot_sales_categories(sales_by_type_significant, 
                      x_var = "product_category", 
                      y_var = "total_sales_value", 
                      fill_var = "product_type", 
                      title = "Total Sales Value by Product Category and Product Type", 
                      y_label = "Total Sales Value", 
                      y_breaks_by = 10000,
                      label_prefix = "$")

```

The analysis of sales by product type of the best selling categories shows:

The top three best-selling product types were *Brewed Chai Tea (sold 26,250 times), Gourmet Brewed Coffee (sold 25,973 times), and Barista Espresso (sold 24,943 times)*.
The top three product types generating the highest profit were *Barista Espresso (\$91,406), Brewed Chai Tea (\$77,082), and Hot Chocolate (\$72,416 from 17,457 sales)*.

It is important to note that the best-selling product type did not generate the highest profit, but still are in top three product types generating the highest profit. Let's ensure there is correlation between products sold and total sales value.

``` {r correlation between units sold and profit, width = 24, height = 6}
# Create scatter plot showing the relationship between units sold and total sales value (profit)
ggplot(sales_by_type_significant, aes(x = total_sales_qty, y = total_sales_value)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = product_type), size = 4, alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "darkred", size = 0.5) +
  scale_color_manual(values = merged_palette) +
  labs(title = "Correlation Between Units Sold and Total Profit by Product Type",
       x = "Units Sold",
       y = "Total Sales Value ($)",
       color = "Product Type") +
  theme_custom +
  theme(
    legend.title = element_text(size = 8),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 6),
    legend.key.size = unit(0.1, "cm")
  )
```

The pink line represents the trend line (using linear regression), showing the general positive relationship between units sold and total sales value. This means that, as the number of units sold increases, total sales value generally increases as well. Since The correlation between sales and profit is positive, but the relationship isn't perfect—some products deviate from the trend.
No product types were discovered that had low sales but high profit, indicating that products that generate significant revenue generally also have high sales volumes.

**Ensuring that all stores are regularly stocked with these high-performing products is crucial, as they play a significant role in both sales volume and revenue.**

### 4.1.3.   Sales By Product ID

There are 80 unique product IDs in the dataset, but for this analysis, I concentrated on the Top 10 items that contribute the most significant portion of the total profit or were best-sellers. 

``` {r product id}
# Calculate the total profit for each product_id
sales_profit <- data_sales %>%
  group_by(product_id, product_detail) %>%
  summarise(
    total_sales_qty = sum(transaction_qty, na.rm = TRUE),
    total_sales_value = sum(transaction_qty * unit_price, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(desc(total_sales_value))  # Sort by total sales value in descending order

# Select the top 10 items contributing the most profit 
top_10_products_sales <- sales_profit %>%
  slice_max(order_by = total_sales_value, n = 10)

# Select the top 10 items by quantity sold
top_10_products_sales <- sales_profit %>%
  arrange(desc(total_sales_qty)) %>%
  slice(1:10)

ggplot(top_10_products_sales, aes(x = reorder(product_id, total_sales_value), y = total_sales_value, fill = product_detail)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste("$", round(total_sales_value))),
              size = 3, 
              fontface = "bold", 
              colour = "white",
              position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = merged_palette) +
  labs(title = "Top 10 Products by Total Profit",
       x = "Product ID",
       y = "Total Sales Value ($)",
       fill = "Product Detail") +
  theme_custom +
  theme(
    legend.title = element_text(size = 12),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 8),
    legend.key.size = unit(0.3, "cm")
  )

ggplot(top_10_products_sales, aes(x = reorder(product_id, total_sales_qty), y = total_sales_qty, fill = product_detail)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() +
   geom_text(aes(label = paste("n = ", round(total_sales_qty))),
              size = 3, 
              fontface = "bold", 
              colour = "white",

  theme(
    legend.title = element_text(size = 12),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 8),
    legend.key.size = unit(0.3, "cm")
  )
```
Since the previous analysis didn't provide sufficient insights, I decided to focus on identifying which drink sizes were the best sellers within the coffee, tea, and drinking chocolate categories. 

``` {r}
# Extract drink size from product_detail
sales_by_size <- data_sales %>%
  filter(product_category %in% c("Coffee", "Tea", "Drinking Chocolate")) %>%
  mutate(
    drink_size = case_when(
      grepl("Sm", product_detail) ~ "Small",
      grepl("Rg", product_detail) ~ "Regular",
      grepl("Lg", product_detail) ~ "Large",
      TRUE ~ "Unknown"
    )
  ) %>%
  group_by(product_category, drink_size) %>%
  summarise(total_sales_qty = sum(transaction_qty, na.rm = TRUE),
            total_sales_value = sum(transaction_qty * unit_price, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_sales_qty))

# Plot the total sales by drink size for each category
ggplot(sales_by_size, aes(x = product_category, y = total_sales_qty, fill = drink_size)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge2(width = 0.9)) +
  geom_label(aes(label = paste("n=", round(total_sales_qty), sep = ""), group = drink_size),
               fill = "white", 
               size = 2, 
               fontface = "bold", 
               label.size = 0.2,
               vjust = -0.5,
               position = position_dodge2(width = 0.9)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = merged_palette) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma, 
                       breaks = seq(0, max(sales_by_size$total_sales_qty) * 1.2, by = 5000),
                     limits = c(0, max(sales_by_size$total_sales_qty) * 1.2)) +
  labs(title = "Best-Selling Drink Sizes by Category", 
       x = "Product Category", 
       y = "Total Sales Quantity",
       fill = "Drink Size") +

ggplot(sales_by_size, aes(x = product_category, y = total_sales_value, fill = drink_size)) +

  geom_label(aes(label = paste("$", round(total_sales_value), sep = ""), group = drink_size),
               fill = "white", 
               size = 2, 
               fontface = "bold", 
               label.size = 0.2,
               vjust = -0.5,
               position = position_dodge2(width = 0.9)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = merged_palette) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma, 
                       breaks = seq(0, max(sales_by_size$total_sales_value) * 1.2, by = 25000),
                     limits = c(0, max(sales_by_size$total_sales_value) * 1.2)) +
  labs(title = "Total Sales Value by Drink Size and Category", 
       x = "Product Category", 
       y = "Total Sales Value ($)",
       fill = "Drink Size") +
  theme_custom

```

This visualization helps highlight which drink sizes are most popular in each product category, with Large and Regular sizes standing out across all categories.

These insights suggest that stocking and promoting Large and Regular drinks should be a priority for maximizing both sales volume and profit in these categories. Efforts should be focused on ensuring these sizes are always available, especially in the Tea and Drinking Chocolate categories.

There is little variation in the quantity of products sold, total profit, and sales across different product categories among the three stores. Similarly, the average sales per transaction are quite consistent across the stores, indicating that customer spending patterns are generally similar.

The graph shows that sales of Coffee and Tea products increase significantly from February to June. Sales in other product categories, such as Bakery, Drinking Chocolate, and Coffee beans, also rise over this period, though less sharply than Coffee and Tea. Other categories also experience growth, but more gradually.

The demand for Coffee and Tea remained steady in January, then started to rise from February through June. This pattern suggests that colder weather might have sustained demand early in the year, while warmer spring months encouraged even more consumption. Meanwhile, categories like Flavours and Packaged Chocolate maintained steady, year-round demand with minimal seasonal impact.

To confirm these patterns, analyzing data over multiple years or incorporating weather data could help determine if these trends repeat each year.
